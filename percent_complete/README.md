Percent Complete
===========

Instead of showing my clients the welcome panel widget, I show them this widget that I find more useful and that lists them all the actions they can do on their website.

I find it really useful in a Network installation. Then the clients need less training.

You can add your custom actions by implementing the ITodoItem interface and register yourself to PercentComplete.
